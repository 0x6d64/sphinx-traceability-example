Introduction
============

The only purpose of the exemplum package is to demonstrate the functionality of
the `melexis fork`_ of the `sphinx-traceability-extension`_.

In this example we pretend to implement a simple piece of software. Its
requirements are documented in the section :ref:`sec-requirements`.

The chapter :ref:`sec-modules` contains documentation of the implementation
and the chapter :ref:`sec-unittests` the documentation of the tests.

The chapter :ref:`sec-versions` contains an overview over versions of the
example software.
